#  COâ‚‚ Emissions Analysis & Train Regression Model to predict  COâ‚‚ emissions

##  Objective

This project aims to analyze **COâ‚‚ emissions from vehicles** and build predictive models to understand the factors influencing emissions.
We explore how vehicle characteristics (engine size, cylinders, fuel type, transmission, etc.) impact emissions and suggest practical recommendations to reduce COâ‚‚.

---
## Project Overview

This project focuses on predicting COâ‚‚ emissions (g/km) of vehicles using regression models. The dataset contains both categorical features (e.g., Make, Model, Vehicle Class, Transmission, Fuel Type) and numerical features (e.g., Engine Size, Cylinders, Fuel Consumption).

The goal is to:

#vCompare models using all features vs. only the most correlated features.

Handle issues of multicollinearity.

Apply regularization techniques (Ridge, Lasso) for model improvement.
##  Background

Carbon dioxide (COâ‚‚) emissions are a major contributor to **climate change** and air pollution, affecting both the environment and human health.
By analyzing real-world vehicle data, we can:

* Identify the factors that increase emissions
* Suggest cleaner technologies & policies
* Build predictive models to estimate emissions

##  Regression Models

### Model 1 â€“ All Features

* Included all categorical + numerical features
* Categorical features encoded via One-Hot Encoding.
* Trained a Linear Regression model.
# Result:
* **RMSE:** Root Mean Squared Error: 0.0001218
* Predictions are very close to actual values.

### Model 2 â€“ Most Correlated Features

* Features: Engine Size, Cylinders, Fuel Consumption
* Strong model fit, explains ~91% variance in test data.
# Result:
* **Training RÂ²:** 0.911
* **Testing RÂ²:** 0.908


### Hyperparameter Tuning â€“ Regularization

* **Lasso Regression:** Poor performance (RÂ² â‰ˆ 0)
* **Ridge Regression:** Similar to Linear Regression (RÂ² â‰ˆ 0.91)
* Failed to capture variance â†’ Not suitable for this dataset.

| Linear Regression (All Features)        | â€“           | â€“          | **0.0001218** | Best accuracy with all data           |
| Linear Regression (Correlated Features) | 0.911       | 0.908      | â€“             | Slightly less accurate, simpler model |
| Ridge Regression                        | 0.911       | 0.908      | â€“             | Robust to multicollinearity           |

##  Recommendations

*  Choose **smaller engines & fewer cylinders**
*  Use **alternative fuels** (ethanol, natural gas, electric)
*  Prefer **public transportation**
*  Support **stricter emission laws**
*  Drive responsibly (inflated tires, no idling, smooth driving)

---
## Key Takeaways

* All independent variables are strongly correlated with COâ‚‚ emissions.

* Model 1 (all features) gives the lowest RMSE.

* Model 2 (correlated features) still performs well with fewer variables.

* Multicollinearity is present but doesnâ€™t heavily degrade prediction performance.

* Ridge regression offers stability but doesnâ€™t significantly improve results.

* Lasso regression is unsuitable for this dataset.
##  Conclusion

* **Engine size, cylinders, and fuel consumption** strongly influence COâ‚‚ emissions.
* **Transmission type and fuel choice** also play significant roles.
* Predictive models (RÂ² â‰ˆ 0.91) perform well in estimating emissions.
* Collective actionsâ€”policy changes, technological innovation, and eco-friendly choicesâ€”can help mitigate climate change.
